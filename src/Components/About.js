           A Full Stack Developer who enjoys building web applications that are simple, useful, and user-friendly.

I have hands-on experience with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), along with Java and SQL. I like working on both frontend and backend, and I enjoy understanding how everything connects behind the scenes.

My main interest is in creating full-stack applications that solve problems in a clean and practical way. Right now, Iâ€™m learning more about backend optimization and scalable systems.

I believe in writing clean code, learning something new every day, and growing step by step in the world of tech.
